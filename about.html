          <h3>Lucas -</h3>
          <p>Hello! I'm Lucas, one of the two photographers at LJ.Photography.</p><br>
          <p>At 13 years old, I already have 2 years of experience in aviation, event, and family photography. I was born and raised in ÅŒtautahi, Christchurch.</p><br>
          <p>On the "Photos" page, you can find some of my work showcased alongside photos from my friend Joseph, the other photographer.</p><br>
          <p>The primary motivation behind starting this business was to enhance my confidence and skills as a photographer.</p><br>
          <h3>Joseph -</h3>
          <p>Hello! I'm Joseph, one of the two photographers at LJ.Photography.</p><br>
          <p>At 13 years old, I have had 1 year of experience in photography, this includes aviation photography and general photography. I was born and raised in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p><br>
          <p>The thing that sparked my interest in photography was when I went plane spotting for the first time. I liked plane spotting more than photography at the time, but then I bought a camera and from there I developed a hobby for photography. Now I do both general and aviation photography.</p><br>
          <p>Throughout my time as a photographer, I have had 2 cameras, my first camera was a Nikon D3100. Which wasn't really good but good at the start. Then half a year later I bought a new Canon 200D Mark II. If you'd like to see some of my photos just check out the "photos" page and you'll see some of Lucas' and I's work.</p><br>
          <p>Ever since I really got into photography, I've always wanted to start a business like this. The thing that made starting this business even better was the fact I was doing it with one of my good friends.</p><br>
